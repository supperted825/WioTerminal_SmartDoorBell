# WioTerminal_SmartDoorBell
Smart Doorbell project for the Wio Terminal.

Turn your Wio Terminal into a doorbell with IoT capabilities. Works with a Grove PIR Sensor of your choice and the Blynk platform to deliver real-time monitoring and notifications.

Theoretically, this should work fine with any other Arduino-compatible board. However, it will need to be reconfigured for the right pins (and LCD display if you choose to use it).
